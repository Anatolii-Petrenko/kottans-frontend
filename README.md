> I had a basic knowledge of the structure of the directory tree in Unix systems and the basic commands in the terminal. The course helped to extend my knowledge and make practice in "zsh".

- Familiarized with HTTP from articles:

## HTML-CSS-Popup

[Demo](https://anatolii-petrenko.github.io/popup-task-html-css/)

> This task helps better understand how and when flex should be applied and when will be better to apply grids. Also, it was a great practice of working with classes, especially with the namings of the classes. I will use the knowledge gained during this task in future projects.

## JS Basics

It was not easy for me to pass the tasks. I spent more than two weeks completing all the necessary tasks. Unfortunately some of the tasks I couldn't solve at all without hints. Surprisingly, the passage of "Algorithm Scripting Challenges" was easier than others for me, perhaps because I gradually started to understand on which side to approach the task.
I hope that it will turn out to apply the acquired knowledge in practice in the subsequent practical tasks.
